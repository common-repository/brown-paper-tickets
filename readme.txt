The Brown Paper Tickets Plugin is a simple way to display your Brown Paper Tickets events in a WordPress post/page.

**This plugin is no longer actively developed or supported by Brown Paper Tickets. Feel free to use it as-is (it works quite well for many sites), but please do not contact Brown Paper Tickets directly for support on this plugin.**

== Description ==

The Brown Paper Tickets plugin is a simple way to display events in a WordPress post/page. You can display a single event, a list of all events or all of your events in a calendar.

The Brown Paper Tickets plugin is Free Software, released under the [GNU GPL v2 or later](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt). Certain libraries used by the plugin (see About section) are licensed under the MIT License.

**There are some caveats to using this plugin. PLEASE READ!**

* Please be aware that this plugin is no longer actively supported by Brown Paper Tickets. While this plugin continues to work well for many users, you may encounter errors and bugs. All usage is as-is, at your own risk.

* The data returned by the [pricelist] (http://www.brownpapertickets.com/apidocs/2.0/pricelist.html) API call does not make a distinction between password protected prices and regular prices. As a result, prices that are typically hidden by passwords on BPT will show up via the plugin. **DO NOT use this plugin if you intend to use the event list feature or want your password protected prices to stay hidden.** Calendar format should be OK as it does not make the price list API call.

== Installation ==

To install the plugin, download the zip, extract it and upload the extracted folder to your plugins directory on your webserver.

From there, activate the plugin as normal. The plugin should take you through a setup wizard. If for some reason it doesn't, on the bottom of your WordPress Admin menu you should see a "BPT Settings" link.

To obtain your developer ID, you must first have developer tools added to your Brown Paper Tickets account. First log into your account on the Brown Paper Tickets website, then go to [Account Functions](https://www.brownpapertickets.com/user/functions.html). Click Developer Tools and then add. You'll see a new link in the top navigation titled "Developer". Click that and you'll see your developer ID listed at the top.

Your client ID is typically whatever you use to log into the Brown Paper Tickets site.

== Plugin Usage ==

To use the plugin place the shortcode ``` [list_event] ``` in the post
or page that you want the listing to appear.

= All Events =

[list_events]

= Single Event Listing =
Use the ```[list_events event_id="XXXXXX"]``` shortcode to display a single event (XXXXXX is the event ID).

**The default shipping options set by the plugin are Will-Call and Print at Home. If your events are using something different, go to the "BPT Settings" page in the WordPress Admin to set them.**

= Calendar Format =

Display a calendar listing all of your events:

    [event_calendar]

You can optionally pass in a ```client_id``` attribute to display another producers events in a calendar.

== About the Calendar ==

This plugin makes use of the following Free/Open Source Software:

- [CLNDR.js](http://kylestetz.github.io/CLNDR/)

- [Ractive.js](http://www.ractivejs.org/)

- [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've updated some of my events on Brown Paper Tickets but the changes are not showing up in the plugin. Why is that? =

You have most likely enabled the plugin's cache so it's not pulling in the new event data.

There are a few ways to solve this:
    - You could wait for the cache to expire.
    - You could delete the cache and force the plugin to refresh the data.
        - To do that, simply go to the "General Settings" tab above and click "Delete Cache".

= I am 100% certain that my developer ID and client ID are correct. What is going on? =

It's possible that your client ID is not attached to your developer tools.

To add your account:

- Go to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.brownpapertickets.com/developer/accounts.html">Authorized Accounts</a> on the Brown Paper Tickets website.

- If your account is listed under "Current Account", click "Edit" and then "Delete Account".

- On the next screen, under "Add a Client" enter in your username and password, select the permissions you need and hit "Add Client Account".

- Your account should now be authorized.

= My password protected prices are being displayed by the plugin, how do I prevent that? =

When you're logged into WordPress as an Administrator, go to the post/page where the event list is being displayed. You should see a green "HIDE PRICE" link under the prices. Clicking that will hide the price from any visitor to the site who is not logged in as an admin.

= How can I customize the look and feel of the event list or the calendar? =

Go to BPT Settings and click on the appearance tab. You can add custom CSS there.
